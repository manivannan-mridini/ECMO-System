# ECMO-System
Enhancing the ECMO System Through Redesign

This was a group project on medical device imrpovement for my Anatomy and Physiology class. 

My contribution: Proposed evidence-based functional optimisations for the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) system, focusing specifically on gold and silver nanoparticle cannula coatings to minimise risks associated with plugging the device into a human body, like thrombosis, immune responses (rejection) and shock by improving biocompatibility and reducing cytotoxicity. Additionally, I addressed the sustainability aspect of the ECMO, including potential improvements and applications to make treatment more accessible to people from all demographics and backgrounds, and suggested material replacements and combinations to increase bioderadability (reduce pollution from disposal) and increase the longevity and durability of the device parts.
